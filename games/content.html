<h2>Basket Random: A Chaotic 2-Player Arcade Sports Game</h2>

<p><strong>Basket Random</strong> is a chaotic 2-player arcade sports game featuring unpredictable physics. Bounce and battle for the ball across wild courts, with each dunk launching you to the next level!</p>

<h2>How to Play Basket Random</h2>
<p>This two-player basketball game follows the typical basketball concept—shoot the ball into the net—but with odd and hilarious twists. There are two teams, each consisting of two players. You control both players, but their movements might not always be what you expect. Slam dunks are still very possible!</p>

<p>Use the <strong>W</strong> key to control player one and the <strong>up arrow</strong> to control player two. Fight frantically over the basketball, bouncing and spinning in the air, trying to make the shot. The team that scores first wins the round. The first player to reach 5 wins the game!</p>

<p>After each Basket Random goal, you’re transported to a new court where the physics and attire may change randomly, adding fresh challenges to each round. Bobble around shooting hoops and enjoy this wacky twist on basketball.</p>
